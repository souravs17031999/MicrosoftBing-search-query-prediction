# MicrosoftBing-search-query-prediction 

# Problem statement:
The world is going through COVID-19 pandemic caused due to Novel
Coronavirus and people are mostly in their homes across the world due to
lockdown and they are searching for various things related to Coronavirus on
internet using popular search engines such as Chrome, Bing, Yahoo,
DuckDuckGo etc.    
Now, the problem task is to attempt to explore the intent of the people by just
using the queries (searches) in the last four months Jan to April 2020 and also
build a predicting model which predicts the Country of origin from where the
search query was issued , as search queries made by people can really help in
understanding what’s going in people’s mind during this pandemic and
exploring the queries at global level as well as state level granularity will enable
state and central authorities to take appropriate action and eventually helping
out and benefitting the Citizens.
